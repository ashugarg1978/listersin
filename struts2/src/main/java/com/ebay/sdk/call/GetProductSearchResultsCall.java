 * Wrapper class of the GetProductSearchResults call of eBay SOAP API.
 * <br>
 * <p>Title: SOAP API wrapper library.</p>
 * <p>Description: Contains wrapper classes for eBay SOAP APIs.</p>
 * <p>Copyright: Copyright (c) 2009</p>
 * <p>Company: eBay Inc.</p>
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>ProductSearch</code> - Specifies the keywords or attributes that make up the product query, with
 * pagination instructions. ProductSearch is a required input. To search for
 * multiple different products at the same time (i.e., to perform a batch
 * search), pass in multiple ProductSearch properties.
 * <br> <B>Output property:</B> <code>ReturnedDataElementSets</code> - Container for one or more DataElement fields containing supplemental
 * helpful data. A DataElement field is an HTML snippet that specifies hints
 * for the user, help links, help graphics, and other supplemental
 * information that varies per characteristic set. Usage of this information
 * is optional and may require you to inspect the information to determine
 * how it can be applied in an application. Also returned with warnings when
 * no matches are found.
 * <br> <B>Output property:</B> <code>ReturnedProductSearchResult</code> - Contains the attributes and product details that match the attributes or
 * query keywords passed in the request. Always returned when product search
 * results are found.

  /**
   * Searches for Pre-filled Item Information within one or more characteristic sets.
   * This kind of search is only applicable in the context of the Sell Your Item use
   * case. Use the response to present the seller with a list of products found in a
   * catalog. (For buy-side searches, use GetSearchResults.)<br>
   * <br>
   * See the Attributes and Catalogs section of the eBay Web Services guide for
   * background information and terminology definitions, as well as information about
   * how to use this call in the Sell Your Item flow.<br>
   * <br>
   * You can use this call to search for different products at the same time. That is,
   * this call can perform batch searches.<br>
   * <br>
   * Given an array of ProductSearch properties that are configured with a list of
   * search attributes or keywords (and other information), GetProductSearchResults
   * searches an eBay catalog for products that match each query. Some queries can be
   * configured to also specify a sort order for the results.<br>
   * <br>
   * To configure a ProductSearch object to search by attributes, you need a valid
   * combination of search attributes. If you want to use a sort order other than the
   * default order, you also need a valid sort attribute. We offer two calls that
   * return product search and sort attributes. Use GetCategory2CS to determine which
   * one of these calls you can use for a given category. At least one approach is
   * offered for each catalog-enabled category, and some cases, both are
   * offered.<br>
   * <br>
   * <b>GetProductSearchPage</b>: Use this call when you want to configure
   * a simple query that consists of a single search attribute (with a value). This
   * retrieves a single product or a very short list of search results to choose from.
   * Some products are fairly easy to find based on a single attribute. For example, in
   * Consumer Electronics categories (Digital Cameras, Cell Phones, and PDAs), you can
   * specify a unique (or nearly unique) identifier, like a part number. In Media
   * categories (Books, DVDs & Movies, Music, and Video Games), you can specify a
   * descriptive name, like a title. <br>
   * <br>
   * <b>GetProductFinder</b>: Use this call when you want to configure a
   * complex query. In the Sell Your Item flow, this is a complex query against the
   * eBay product catalog. Currently, this type of search is available in Consumer
   * Electronics categories only. In this type of search, you specify values for
   * multiple attributes, like Brand and Resolution (i.e., number of megapixels). This
   * retrieves a list of matching products. This approach is useful when the user does
   * not know the part number, or a product does not have a single, distinguishing
   * feature that is easy to search on. For example, searching for a digital camera
   * based solely on the brand would likely yield far too many results to be useful.
   * Searching on the brand, product line, and resolution will retrieve a much shorter
   * list of results. <br>
   * <br>
   * Alternatively, you can search on a particular keyword that appears in a product's
   * title or Item Specifics. For this, you use GetProductSearchResults and and pass in
   * one or more text strings (with optional wildcards) in ProductSearch.QueryKeywords.
   * <br>
   * <br>
   * When you use a keyword query, the search criteria are not restricted to the
   * results of a product search page or product finder, so the criteria are not tied
   * to a particular characteristic set. This means you can search across multiple
   * characteristic sets using the same query. This is useful when the user wants to
   * broaden their search across multiple categories. For example, a seller who sells
   * Jazz books, Jazz CDs, and Jazz movies may want to search for "Bird" across
   * multiple categories. Specify the characteristic set IDs of interest by using
   * CharacteristicSetIDs. <br>
   * <br>
   * GetProductSearchResults returns a list of matching products, if any. Each product
   * is represented as a list of attributes (Item Specifics) plus other identifying
   * information, such as a product ID and a stock photo. <br>
   * <br>
   * Once the user selects a product from the list (this may require a call to
   * GetProductFamilyMembers to retrieve additional products to choose from), pass its
   * ID in a GetProductSellingPages request to retrieve more detailed information about
   * each product, including a set of optional Item Specifics that the seller can use
   * in addition to the pre-filled Item Specifics (see GetProductSellingPages).
   * <br>
   * <br>
   * To use this data in a listing, pass the product ID and the optional Item Specifics
   * in the seller's listing request (AddItem).
